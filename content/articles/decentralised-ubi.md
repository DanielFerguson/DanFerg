Please note that this article discusses some points that have been on my mind regarding what the future economy of Australia may look like, the challenges our current system will face and the potential changes in society we will see if we move to a Universal Basic Income in an era that relies on decentralised cryptocurrencies. This article is not an artifact to be seen as my personal endorsement for either scenario, it is merely a thought exercise.

- How does digital soverignty solve the issue of knowing who can accept funding?
- Why decentralised cryptocurrency?
